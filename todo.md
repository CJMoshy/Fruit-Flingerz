manager classes

lock in for the sprites
 - ui and stuff is done but the logic to pass the correct sprite to the player needs work

- there is a bug with the client server interactions where old player wont spawn immediately on new player screen
 - might be fixed?

- connection manager is still setup to default lots of textures initially. This techincally doesnt seem to be an issue right now but will likely prove to be issue in the future with people connecting from different computers (ping diff)
